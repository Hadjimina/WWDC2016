The App centered around the lifes of historic people. One could choose from three different people : Mahatma Gandhi, Albert Eistein and Martin Luther King. One could look at their timeline and see when, where and what happend in their lifes. 
You could also track a certain person. The idea of this feature was basically to be able to put a geofence around some points of interest for the hisotric people. (i.e. Places in India where Gandhi visited etc.) The user would get a notification on his phone and could immediately check the description for this history place.
